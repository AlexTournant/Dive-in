            <h3>The company</h3>
            <p>Dive'in is a company aiming to make scuba diving accessible to as many people as possible. We want both to be able to initiate each volunteer, but also to benefit the most experienced divers. We therefore offer several activities concerning scuba diving, ranging from first dives to multi-day group courses. The required equipment is loaned, but each diver is allowed to use his own equipment if he wishes.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>We are also very impacted by the ecology, and by the pollution of our coasts, that is why we organize cleaning campaigns on the coasts, the ports, and the beaches, all volunteers are welcome. These events are often in collaboration with associations fighting against pollution.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>We organize events all over the French coasts, the details of the places, dates and formalities can be found in the "Diving" and "Cleaning" tabs.</p>
